# Virtual-tablet

**Purpose:**  
The Virtual Tablet project aims to create a virtual writing tablet that enables users to write both on a screen and in the air. This innovative tool leverages computer vision technology to track the pen's tip and accurately determine its position, translating physical writing into a digital format.

**Features:**  
Pen Position Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV to track the position of the penâ€™s tip, allowing precise determination of its actual location.  
Color Detection: Measures the color of the pen tip based on its hue, saturation, and value (HSV) to match the closest solid ink color for digital text creation.  
Digital Document Creation: Converts handwritten input into digital text documents.  
Future Enhancements: The next phase of the Virtual Tablet project involves integrating it with online meeting platforms. This integration will enable the real-time conversion of handwritten slides into digital documents, facilitating seamless sharing and collaboration during virtual meetings.  

**Installation:**  
To install and run the Virtual Tablet project, follow these steps:  
Clone the Repository  
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages using requirements.txt  
Start the virtual tablet application
